libkdtree++ ChangeLog
=====================

2007-11-25 Sylvain Bougerel (sylvain.bougerel.devel@gmail.com)

	- fixed the reverse_iterator. Now it can be used.

2007-10-24  Sylvain Bougerel (sylvain.bougerel.devel@gmail.com)

	- Removal of all the warnings that are yield by the compiler when
	using the following flags:
		-Wall -pedantic -ansi
	Do not hesitate to suggest any flags for additional code checking.

	This release also feature numerous of enhancements by Paul Harris
	(paulharris@computer.org):
		- const kdtrees can be searched
		- find_nearest_if() enforce validation of a predicate
		- visit_within_range() walk the tree and calls
		Visitor::operator() on template argument <Visitor> for
		each node within the range
	- find_exact() matches an kdtree::value_type by location and by
	calling kdtree::value_type::operator==() (in case two different
	items have the same location find_exact() will not return the
	wrong item)
	- erase_exact() is to erase() what find_exact() is to find()
	- check_tree() and num_dist_calcs for debugging purpose plus
	additional improvements on erase and region intersection

2004-11-26  Paul Harris (paulharris@computer.org)

	- New feature: find_nearest()
	- Accessors can now be initialised with the tree, so ptr_fun() 
		or functors can be used to access datapoints.
	- Accessors now much more generic, so you can use the same 
		accessor to access multiple types.
	- Range-constructors now optimise() automatically, simplifying 
		the construction of a filled tree.
	- _Range is now more easy to construct.

2004-11-15  Martin F. Krafft (libkdtree@pobox.madduck.net)

	- fixed numerous little bugs that led to compilation problems
	- changed code to compile cleanly with GCC 3.4 and GCC 4.0

2004-11-06  Martin F. Krafft (libkdtree@pobox.madduck.net)

	- reverted to optimise() to prevent API change, and added an optimize()
	  passthrough method with an appropriate comment.

2004-11-05  Paul Harris (paulharris@computer.org)

	- Renamed optimise() to optimize().
	- Added a full set of range constructors and insert(range) methods.
		it now works with inserter(tree,tree.begin())
	- Target type no longer needs a default constructor. This also fixes
		problems with empty trees (would crash if optimized).
	- Some code cleanup (removed inlines, switched from const_iterator to
		iterator, added this-> to ensure the methods are called).
	- Added a new method: count_within_range().
	- Fixed bug in rend().

2004-11-04  Martin F. Krafft (libkdtree@pobox.madduck.net)

	- Integrated patch by Paul Harris to fix a logic error pertaining to
		OutputIterators in find_within_range. find_within_range() now
		returns the output iterator instead of a count. Thanks, Paul!
	- Added another fix by Paul Harris to _M_get_j_max, which would cause
		a dimensional overflow for trees with depths >= K. Thanks (again) Paul!
	- Made some improvements to the autotools files.

2004-05-11  Martin F. Krafft (libkdtree@pobox.madduck.net)

	- Fixed CFlags and Libs entries in pkgconfig file.

2004-05-11  Martin F. Krafft (libkdtree@pobox.madduck.net)

	- Initial release.
